# Graduate Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Introduction

Students in the graduate version of the course will complete 2 additional assignments.
- A modern book on machine learning approved by the instructor (ie. Genius Makers, The Alignment Problem, Human Compatible)
- An original group project

## Modern Book and Research Papers on Machine Learning

The field of machine learning is constantly evolving but has, at this point, a considerable history. There are several wonderful books on machine learning that provide broad insight acquired from a lifetime of work in machine learning. 

The course staff will be reading "Algorithms to Live By" By Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. Other options are "Genius Makers", "The Alignment Problem", "Human Compatible", and "Weapons of Math Destruction". Other books not on this list are allowed, but must be approved by the instructor. 

There will be an **afternoon discussion** about the reading to be scheduled in the **first half of the semester over donuts and coffee**. The discussion will be centered around machine learning history, modern problems in machine learning, and the future of machine learning. 

5220 students will be required to attend. Any 4220 students who choose to make use of the available extra credit by reading one of the books will also be invited!

## Project 

Students in the graduate course will form into groups, and then propose and conduct an original project that utilizes concepts from both machine learning and data science. Projects related to climate data, natural language processing, or machine vision are encouraged. 

There will be 4 milestones with deadlines to be released soon - (1) proposal and rubric, (2) background literature, (3) implementation demonstration and follow up questions, and (4) evaluation. 

### Project Proposal and Group Formation

This project is intended to be a self-directed problem-based exploration of a question(s) that is mutually interesting to the group. Groups should be between 3 to 5 students and are not set in stone until the project proposal is submitted. 

So, there are two ways to go about forming a group to complete the project proposal.
- Choosing a group based on those with whom you enjoy working.
- Forming a group around a question that is important to you and others.

In research, I follow both paths. There are those that I work with because I like to work with them (this is usually the case for projects with those I already know). Then, there are those that I work with because a problem is mutually very compelling (often this is how I meet new colleagues!). Both paths can be very successful. 

Regardless of how the group forms, the team must formally decide what questions they want to try to answer. The constraints are that the question should be addressable with data that is believably possible to acquire. So, answering the question, "is there an alien outpost on the dark side of the moon" would be challenging to address without a great source for satellite data or a moon mission. 

Referring to the data science life-cycle, the project proposal requires the team to define the questions and to have a plan on how/where they will obtain relevant data. The source of data could be public repositories, hand gathering, or anywhere in-between. 

Additionally, the project proposal should have a section in which the team discusses what success involves. For instance, it may not be possible to decide if homes under powerlines pose a risk in general. But, would it be a success if they could show that the results from previous work on leukemia rates were statistically related to the age of the power line? I would think yes. So, the team should identify subgoals that each contribute to success. In this way, even if the question can't be directly answered, the project is still successful. 

The subgoals are not set in stone. As you explore the data, you may ask additional questions (indeed you should). These can be added to the subgoals. However, the big picture, motivational question will be set in stone after the project proposal is approved by the instructor. 

The proposal (and all written documentation for the graduate proejct) should be written in the [AAAI format](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-press-latex-template/jymjdgdpdmxp&ved=2ahUKEwjS6uLAw4yLAxWXtYQIHZVfMIMQFnoECBIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3HYp1UaLKI7zLDcSnmqOAt). I recommend using overleaf to prepare it. There's a tutorial on overleaf linked on the resources [page](../resources).
